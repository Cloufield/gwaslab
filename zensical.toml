# Navigation
# Note: Zensical is compatible with mkdocs.yml configuration files.
# Since the navigation structure is complex and nested, it's recommended to keep
# the navigation definition in mkdocs.yml. Zensical will read it from there.
# Alternatively, you can define navigation here using Zensical's format if needed.

# Markdown extensions
# Note: Zensical will read markdown_extensions from mkdocs.yml
# These are configured in mkdocs.yml as a list format

# Plugins
# Note: Zensical will read plugins from mkdocs.yml
# Plugins are configured in mkdocs.yml as a list format
