# Hapmap3 SNPs in GWASLab

The Hapmap3 SNPs used in GWASLab were obtained from the file `w_hm3.snplist` used [when munging sumstats for LD score regression](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc/wiki/Heritability-and-Genetic-Correlation). 

This file contains ~1.2M SNPs. Base-pair positions were assigned based on the reference VCF files from dbSNP.
